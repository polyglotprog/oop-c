# Object-Oriented Programming in C

It is well-known that languages like C++, Java, and Ruby provide support for
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). However, it may come as somewhat of a surpise
that OOP can also be done in C &mdash; with much discipline required. This
project demonstrates how to implement inheritance, polymorphism, and
encapsulation in C, drawing concepts and inspiration from the following sources:

1. Axel-Tobias Schreiner's book [_Object-Oriented Programming With ANSI-C_]
2. Michael Safyan's article [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C]
3. Feeping Creature's invaluable blogpost [why single-inheritance
   multiple-interfaces oop is the most beautiful thing]

A result of much experimentation and many [segfaults], the final product is
something that looks and feels somewhat like Java.
